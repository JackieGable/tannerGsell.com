# 📝 Build a Simple Notes App with HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Part 1)

Welcome! In this tutorial, we’re going to build a simple notes app using just **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no complicated setup. This is perfect for beginners who are comfortable with HTML and CSS but are just starting to learn how JavaScript works.



## ✅ What We’re Building

A basic notes app where users can:
- Write a note
- Save the note
- See all their saved notes
- (Later) Delete notes and keep them saved in the browser even after refreshing

Here’s what the final result will look like (more or less — styling is up to you!):

```
+----------------------------------+
|          My Notes App           |
+----------------------------------+
| [Write your note here...]       |
| [ Save Note ]                   |
|---------------------------------|
| - Remember to water the plants  |
| - Call Mom                      |
| - Finish homework               |
+----------------------------------+
```

---

## 📁 Step 1: Project Setup

### 🗂 Folder Structure

Create a new folder anywhere on your computer for this project. Inside that folder, create three files:

```
notes-app/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Create the HTML Skeleton

Open `index.html` in your code editor (like VS Code) and add this basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Simple Notes App</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>My Notes</h1>
    <textarea id="note-input" placeholder="Write your note here..."></textarea>
    <button id="save-btn">Save Note</button>
    <div id="notes-list"></div>
  </div>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 🔍 What’s Going On Here?
- The `<textarea>` is where users will write their notes.
- The `<button>` will trigger saving the note.
- The `<div id="notes-list">` is where we’ll show all the saved notes later.
- The `script.js` file is linked at the bottom so it loads **after** the HTML is ready.

---

## 🎨 Step 3: Add Some Basic Styling

In `style.css`, paste the following to make the app look a little nicer:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 40px;
}

.container {
  max-width: 500px;
  margin: auto;
  background: white;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

textarea {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 16px;
  resize: none;
}

button {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 16px;
  background-color: #2e8b57;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #256d47;
}

#notes-list {
  margin-top: 20px;
}

.note {
  background-color: #eaeaea;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Test Your Setup

Open your `index.html` file in a browser (you can right-click and choose “Open with Live Server” if you're using the Live Server extension in VS Code).

You should see:
- A header
- A text area to write in
- A save button
- A blank space underneath for notes

No JavaScript yet — that’s coming next in **Part 2**!

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


# 📝 Build a Simple Notes App with HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Part 2)

In [Part 1](#), we set up the structure and styling for our notes app using just HTML and CSS. Now it’s time to **make it work** using JavaScript!

By the end of this part, your app will:
- Let users type a note
- Save the note when the button is clicked
- Display the saved note on the page

Let’s dive in.

---

## 🧠 Step 1: What JavaScript Will Do

Before we touch any code, here's what we want to happen:

1. The user types something in the `<textarea>`.
2. They click the "Save Note" button.
3. The app takes the text, creates a note element, and adds it to the list of notes.
4. Clear the input box so they can write another one.

---

## 🧾 Step 2: Get the Elements from the Page

Open your `script.js` file and start by grabbing the elements we need from the HTML:

```javascript
// Get elements from the page
const saveButton = document.getElementById("save-btn");
const noteInput = document.getElementById("note-input");
const notesList = document.getElementById("notes-list");
```

### 💡 What’s Happening?
We’re using `document.getElementById()` to select HTML elements by their `id`. This lets us **interact** with them using JavaScript.

---

## 🖱 Step 3: Add a Click Event Listener

Now we want something to happen when the user clicks the "Save Note" button.

Add this code to your `script.js`:

```javascript
saveButton.addEventListener("click", function () {
  const noteText = noteInput.value;

  // Prevent empty notes
  if (noteText.trim() === "") return;

  // Create a new div for the note
  const note = document.createElement("div");
  note.className = "note";
  note.textContent = noteText;

  // Add the note to the notes list
  notesList.appendChild(note);

  // Clear the textarea
  noteInput.value = "";
});
```

---

### 🧠 Let’s Break It Down:
- `addEventListener("click", function () {...})` runs the code *when the button is clicked*.
- `noteInput.value` grabs the text the user typed.
- We check if the text is empty (`trim()` removes extra spaces).
- `document.createElement("div")` makes a new note element.
- `textContent` sets the text for that note.
- `notesList.appendChild(note)` adds it to the page.
- We clear the input so they can type a new one.

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Test It Out!

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Type a note.
3. Click “Save Note.”
4. Your note should appear below the button.
5. Try adding a few notes — they should all show up.

🎉 **Nice! You just made your first interactive JavaScript app.**

---

## 🧰 Bonus: What’s Next?

Right now the notes disappear when you reload the page. That’s not very helpful, right?

In **Part 3**, we’ll fix that by:
- Saving the notes in the browser using `localStorage`
- Loading saved notes when the app starts

This will make your app feel much more “real” — no backend needed!

---

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Awesome, Jackie — let’s dig into **Part 3**, where your notes app becomes *way* more useful by saving notes even after the page is refreshed. We’ll introduce the `localStorage` API and show how to use it in the simplest way possible for beginners.

---

```markdown
# 📝 Build a Simple Notes App with HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Part 3)

In [Part 2](#), we added JavaScript so that users can:
- Type a note
- Click a button to save it
- See the note appear on the page

That’s cool… but try refreshing the page. 😬

All the notes are gone. Not so cool.

---

## 🗃 Let’s Fix That with localStorage

We’ll use the browser’s built-in `localStorage` feature to **remember notes even after a refresh**. It’s super beginner-friendly and doesn’t require a backend or database.

---

## 🤔 What Is localStorage?

`localStorage` is a way to store data in the browser. Think of it like a little notepad that stays there until you (or the user) deletes it.

- It stores key/value pairs as **strings**
- It doesn’t expire (unlike sessionStorage)
- Perfect for saving simple data like notes

---

## 🎯 Our Plan

Here’s what we want to do:
1. When a note is saved, add it to localStorage
2. When the page loads, read from localStorage and show any saved notes
3. Keep localStorage updated when new notes are added

---

## 🛠 Step 1: Create a Function to Load Saved Notes

At the top of your `script.js` file, add this:

```javascript
function loadNotes() {
  const savedNotes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes")) || [];

  savedNotes.forEach(function (noteText) {
    const note = document.createElement("div");
    note.className = "note";
    note.textContent = noteText;
    notesList.appendChild(note);
  });
}

// Load saved notes when the page loads
loadNotes();
```

### 🧠 What’s Happening?
- `localStorage.getItem("notes")` gets the saved notes (as a string).
- `JSON.parse()` converts it back into an array.
- If there are no saved notes, we default to an empty array with `|| []`.
- Then we loop through the array and display each one.

---

## 💾 Step 2: Update the Save Button Code

Now we need to update the code that runs when the user saves a note, so it also updates `localStorage`.

Replace the existing click event code with this version:

```javascript
saveButton.addEventListener("click", function () {
  const noteText = noteInput.value;

  if (noteText.trim() === "") return;

  const note = document.createElement("div");
  note.className = "note";
  note.textContent = noteText;
  notesList.appendChild(note);

  // Save the note to localStorage
  let savedNotes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes")) || [];
  savedNotes.push(noteText);
  localStorage.setItem("notes", JSON.stringify(savedNotes));

  // Clear the textarea
  noteInput.value = "";
});
```

### 💡 What’s New Here?
- We grab existing notes from localStorage and parse them into an array.
- We push the new note into that array.
- We convert the array back into a string with `JSON.stringify()` and save it.

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Test It Out!

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Add a few notes.
3. Refresh the page.

🎉 Your notes are still there! That’s the power of localStorage.

---

## 🧰 Optional: Clear All Notes (for testing)

If you want a quick way to clear all notes while testing, you can run this in your browser’s DevTools console:

```js
localStorage.clear();
```

(Just make sure to refresh the page after running it.)


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



# 📝 Build a Simple Notes App with HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Part 4)

So far, your notes app can:
- Let users type and save notes
- Display them on the page
- Keep them saved after a refresh using `localStorage`

Now let’s take it up a notch by letting users **delete notes**.

---

## 🧠 What We’ll Do in This Part

1. Add a delete button (🗑️) to each note.
2. When clicked, the note should disappear.
3. Update `localStorage` to reflect the change.

---

## 🛠 Step 1: Update the Note Display Function

We’ll refactor the part of the code that **creates and displays notes** to include a delete button.

Let’s make a reusable function to do this:

```javascript
function createNoteElement(noteText) {
  const note = document.createElement("div");
  note.className = "note";

  const text = document.createElement("span");
  text.textContent = noteText;

  const deleteBtn = document.createElement("button");
  deleteBtn.textContent = "🗑️";
  deleteBtn.className = "delete-btn";

  deleteBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {
    // Remove from the page
    notesList.removeChild(note);

    // Remove from localStorage
    let savedNotes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes")) || [];
    savedNotes = savedNotes.filter(function (noteItem) {
      return noteItem !== noteText;
    });
    localStorage.setItem("notes", JSON.stringify(savedNotes));
  });

  note.appendChild(text);
  note.appendChild(deleteBtn);
  return note;
}
```

### 💡 Why make a function?
It keeps your code **clean and reusable**. We’ll call this function whenever we need to create/display a note.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Update Where Notes Are Created

Now replace your old logic that creates note elements with a call to `createNoteElement()`.

### In the `loadNotes()` function:
Update it like this:

```javascript
function loadNotes() {
  const savedNotes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes")) || [];

  savedNotes.forEach(function (noteText) {
    const note = createNoteElement(noteText);
    notesList.appendChild(note);
  });
}
```

### In the “Save” button event:
Update the code to this:

```javascript
saveButton.addEventListener("click", function () {
  const noteText = noteInput.value;

  if (noteText.trim() === "") return;

  const note = createNoteElement(noteText);
  notesList.appendChild(note);

  let savedNotes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes")) || [];
  savedNotes.push(noteText);
  localStorage.setItem("notes", JSON.stringify(savedNotes));

  noteInput.value = "";
});
```

---

## 🎨 Step 3: Style the Delete Button (Optional)

Add this to your `style.css` to make the delete button look a bit nicer:

```css
.note {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

.delete-btn {
  background: transparent;
  border: none;
  font-size: 18px;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-left: 10px;
}

.delete-btn:hover {
  color: red;
}
```

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Test It Out

1. Add a few notes.
2. Try clicking the 🗑️ next to one of them.
3. Refresh the page — only the notes you kept should still be there.

🎉 It works! Notes are being deleted both visually and from localStorage.

---

## 🧰 Bonus Tip

If you're noticing that sometimes the delete button removes the *wrong* note (like if you have duplicate notes), you can fix this by using **unique IDs** or timestamps instead of just the note text. But for a beginner project, this version keeps things simple and functional.

---

## 🔜 Next Up: Deploy Your App

In **Part 5**, we’ll:
- Clean things up
- Add a little final polish
- Deploy your app online using **GitHub Pages**

This way, you can **share your notes app with the world!**

```

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Sweet, Jackie — let’s bring it home with **Part 5**! You’ve got a functional, interactive notes app — now it’s time to make it look a little more polished and put it online with **GitHub Pages**, so you can share it with others (or just feel cool seeing it live on the web).

---

```markdown
# 📝 Build a Simple Notes App with HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Part 5)

Your app:
✅ Lets users create notes  
✅ Displays them on the page  
✅ Saves notes in `localStorage`  
✅ Allows users to delete notes  

Now let's:
1. Clean up and polish the UI a bit
2. Make sure everything is tidy and working
3. Deploy the app to the web using **GitHub Pages**

---

## ✨ Step 1: Optional UI Polish

Feel free to get creative with this — update the font, tweak the colors, maybe add animations. Here are a few small suggestions you can add to your `style.css` for a cleaner look:

```css
body {
  font-family: "Segoe UI", sans-serif;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #d3cce3, #e9e4f0);
}

.container {
  background-color: #fff;
  padding: 30px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

textarea {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 8px;
}

button#save-btn {
  background-color: #6c63ff;
}

button#save-btn:hover {
  background-color: #554cd1;
}
```

You can also center the app with a simple:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: start;
  min-height: 100vh;
  padding-top: 50px;
}
```

---

## ✅ Step 2: Final Checklist

Make sure your project folder looks like this:

```
notes-app/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

And double-check that:
- All your code is working
- Notes are saved and deleted correctly
- There are no console errors (check with browser dev tools)

---

## 🚀 Step 3: Publish with GitHub Pages

### If You Don’t Have a GitHub Account:
- Sign up at [github.com](https://github.com)

### 📦 Upload Your Project
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Create a **new repository** (you can name it `notes-app`)
3. Leave it public, **don’t initialize with a README**
4. After creating it, follow these steps in your terminal:

```bash
cd path/to/your/notes-app

# Initialize a Git repo
git init

# Add your files
git add .

# Commit your code
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Link to your GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/notes-app.git

# Push your code
