Creating a new web project in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a great way to get started with web development. Here are the steps to set up a new project:

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**:
   Make sure you have VSCode installed. You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install Node.js**:
   You'll need Node.js for most web development projects. Download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm (Node Package Manager), which you'll use to manage project dependencies.

3. **Create a New Project Folder**:
   Create a new folder for your project. You can do this through your file explorer or using the terminal:
   ```sh
   mkdir my-new-web-project
   cd my-new-web-project
   ```

4. **Open the Project in VSCode**:
   Open VSCode and go to `File` -> `Open Folder...`, then select your project folder. Alternatively, you can open the folder directly from the terminal:
   ```sh
   code .
   ```

5. **Initialize a New Node.js Project**:
   In the terminal within VSCode, run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```
   This will create a `package.json` file, which keeps track of your project's dependencies and settings.

6. **Install Web Development Libraries**:
   Depending on your project, you might want to install some libraries. For a basic setup, you can install Express (a web framework for Node.js):
   ```sh
   npm install express
   ```

7. **Create Basic Project Files**:
   Create the following basic files for your project:
   - `index.html`: Your main HTML file.
   - `styles.css`: Your CSS file for styling.
   - `app.js`: Your main JavaScript file.

   You can create these files by right-clicking on the project folder in VSCode and selecting `New File`.

8. **Set Up a Simple Server**:
   In your `app.js` file, you can set up a basic Express server:
   ```js
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   app.use(express.static('public'));

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```

9. **Run Your Project**:
   In the terminal, run the following command to start your server:
   ```sh
   node app.js
   ```

10. **Open Your Browser**:
    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your new web project in action!

These steps should help you set up a basic web project in VSCode. As you develop your project, you can add more features and dependencies as needed.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
