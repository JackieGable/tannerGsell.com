# A Roadmap for Beginning Developers

For a high school student diving into web development, the goal is to build a solid foundation while keeping it fun and practical. Web dev splits into two big areas—front-end (what users see) and back-end (server-side logic)—plus some tooling basics. Here’s a curated list of courses and skills to get started, tailored for a beginner with no prior experience, focusing on free or affordable options that lead to building real websites and web apps.

Core Skills and Recommended Courses
1. HTML & CSS (The Building Blocks)
Why: HTML structures your site, CSS styles it. You can’t skip these—they’re the entry point to web dev.
Courses:
freeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design (free, ~30-40 hours)
Link: freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/
Covers: HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, Grid, responsive design (making sites work on phones and desktops).
Project: Build a survey form, tribute page, and portfolio—great for a beginner’s showcase.
CS50’s Web Development with HTML and CSS (free, ~10-15 hours)
Link: Part of CS50x on edX (Week 8 focuses on web).
Covers: Basics plus practical layouts.
Goal: Build a simple static site (e.g., a personal portfolio) by the end.
2. JavaScript (Making Sites Interactive)
Why: JavaScript adds interactivity—think buttons, forms, animations. It’s essential for web apps.
Courses:
freeCodeCamp: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (free, ~40-50 hours)
Link: freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/
Covers: Variables, loops, functions, DOM manipulation (changing page content dynamically).
Project: Build a calculator or palindrome checker—small but satisfying.
The Odin Project: Foundations + JavaScript Path (free, ~60-80 hours for basics)
Link: theodinproject.com
Covers: JS basics, plus real-world practice with HTML/CSS.
Bonus: Teaches Git early (version control—super useful).
Goal: Add interactivity to your portfolio (e.g., a dark mode toggle or contact form).
3. Git & GitHub (Version Control and Sharing)
Why: Git tracks your code changes; GitHub hosts it online. It’s how pros collaborate and showcase work.
Courses:
Codecademy: Learn Git & GitHub (free tier, ~5-10 hours)
Link: codecademy.com/learn/learn-git
Covers: git add, git commit, git push, plus GitHub repos and pull requests.
GitHub’s Quickstart (free, ~1-2 hours)
Link: skills.github.com
Covers: Basics via interactive labs.
Goal: Push your portfolio to GitHub and share the link.
4. Intro to Web Apps (Pick One Path)
Why: Static sites are cool, but web apps (e.g., to-do lists, games) need logic. Choose front-end or back-end to start.
Front-End Option: React (JavaScript Framework)
Course: Scrimba: Learn React (free tier, ~10-15 hours)
Link: scrimba.com/learn/learnreact
Covers: Components, state, props—modern web app basics.
Project: Build a simple app like a counter or to-do list.
Why: React’s huge in the job market and builds on JS.
Back-End Option: Node.js + Express (Server-Side)
Course: freeCodeCamp: Back End Development and APIs (free, ~20-30 hours)
Link: freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/
Covers: Node.js, Express, basic APIs (data fetching).
Project: Build a URL shortener or timestamp app.
Why: Opens the door to full-stack (front + back) skills.
5. Bonus: Eleventy (Static Sites Made Easy)
Why: As we discussed, Eleventy’s a lightweight way to build fast sites with Markdown and JS—perfect for portfolios or blogs.
Course: Build a Blog with Eleventy by freeCodeCamp (free, ~2-5 hours)
Link: Search YouTube for “Eleventy freeCodeCamp” (e.g., Beau Carnes’ tutorial).
Covers: Setup, templates, deployment.
Goal: Turn your portfolio into an Eleventy site and host it free on Netlify or GitHub Pages.

Suggested Learning Path (6-12 Months)
Month 1-2: HTML/CSS (freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design) + start a portfolio site.
Month 3-4: JavaScript (freeCodeCamp JS or Odin Project) + add interactivity to your site.
Month 5: Git/GitHub (Codecademy) + push your portfolio online.
Month 6-8: Pick React or Node.js (Scrimba or freeCodeCamp) + build a small web app.
Month 9+: Try Eleventy for a polished site + explore more (e.g., databases, design).
Total Time: ~100-150 hours spread over 6-12 months (2-5 hours/week). Adjust based on your pace—high schoolers are busy!

Tools You’ll Need
Computer: Any decent laptop (Windows, Mac, Linux).
Text Editor: VS Code (free, code.visualstudio.com)—it’s the dev standard.
Browser: Chrome or Firefox for testing (DevTools are your friend).
Node.js: For JS-based tools like Eleventy (install from nodejs.org).

Tips for a High School Student
Start Small: Don’t aim for Facebook on day one—build a site about your hobbies (games, sports, art).
Show Off: Share projects with friends, teachers, or on X to get feedback and motivation.
Join Communities: Reddit’s r/learnprogramming or Discord coding servers (e.g., The Odin Project’s) are great for help.
Portfolio Early: Colleges and internships love seeing a GitHub with real projects.

Why This Works
This mix gives you front-end (HTML/CSS/JS), tools (Git), and a taste of web apps (React or Node.js)—enough to build cool stuff and decide what you like. Plus, freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project are hands-on and free, perfect for a student budget. If you’ve got cash, Udemy’s “Web Developer Bootcamp” by Colt Steele (~$15 on sale) is a solid all-in-one alternative.
