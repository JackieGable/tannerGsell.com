## 🌐 How to Get a Free GitHub Account

GitHub is like cloud storage for your code. Here’s how to sign up:

### 1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)

Click the **“Sign up”** button in the top right corner.

### 2. Fill Out the Form

- Choose a **username** (this will be your public GitHub name)
- Add your **email address**
- Create a **strong password**
- Click **“Create account”**

### 3. Verify Your Email

GitHub will send you a confirmation email. Click the link in that email to verify your account.

### 4. Choose Free Plan

Select the **Free** plan (you can upgrade later if needed). It gives you unlimited public and private repositories—more than enough to get started.

### 5. Skip the Setup (Optional)

GitHub might ask you some questions like your experience level. You can skip or answer them—your choice!
